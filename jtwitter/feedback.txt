Winterwell's Java Twitter library jtwitter is cool.	tedwen
Your twitter API is amazing. The other ones make it unnecessarily difficult to do anything by being incredibly verbose, with no real gains in robustness. Your API is simple and took me 5 seconds to figure out. Thanks a bunch, great work.	Paul Gibler
